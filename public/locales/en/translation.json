  "aboutPageTitle": "About the Project",
  "aboutLearningTitle": "What I Learned",
  "aboutLearningText": "This project was a deep, practical exercise in global state management with React. The main challenge was centralizing all app logic (goals, XP, badges) inside a single `DataContext` using the Context API, ensuring immutability and persistence via `localStorage`.\n\nI learned to build custom hooks (`useData`, `useTheme`) to consume these contexts cleanly. For the UI, I used TailwindCSS for a responsive layout and implemented a custom Light/Dark Mode system controlled by a class on the HTML tag.\n\nThe most complex feature was internationalization (i18n) using `i18next` and `react-i18next`, allowing dynamic switching between Portuguese and English and loading external JSON files.\n\nFinally, I integrated professional-grade libraries like `Recharts` for data visualization (Radar Chart) and `Framer Motion` for UI animations, along with full CRUD logic (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) for Tracks and Goals.",

  "aboutChallengesTitle": "Challenges and Solutions",
  "aboutChallengesText": "The biggest technical challenge was a dependency conflict. Installing `i18next` (which required TypeScript 5) conflicted with `react-scripts` (locked to TypeScript 4). I solved the `ERESOLVE` error by using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, learning more about package management in older ecosystems like Create React App.\n\nAnother major challenge was asynchronous state logic. After adding i18n, the app only displayed translation keys (like `navHome`) instead of the actual text. I diagnosed it as a race condition: React rendered before `i18next` finished loading `translation.json`. The fix was wrapping the app with `<Suspense>` in `index.js` to make React wait for translations.\n\nFinally, ensuring immutability in the `DataContext` was complex. A single action (like `updateGoal`) had to recalculate progress, add XP, and check for new badges. I solved it by consistently using the `setData(prev => ...)` updater form to always operate on the freshest state.",

  "aboutNextStepsTitle": "Next Steps",
  "aboutNextStepsText": "Although this project is feature-complete, the next logical step would be migrating from `localStorage` to a cloud-based solution like **Firebase** or **Supabase**.\n\nThe plan includes:\n1. **User Authentication** with Firebase Authentication.\n2. **Cloud Database** using Firestore.\n3. **Improved Streak Logic** for daily learning.\n4. **Testing** with Jest and React Testing Library.",
